          <p class="feature__description">As you teach others and gain knowledge, every minute spent equates to a set, these points then allow the student to be ranked on the leaderboard and redeem gifts such as subscriptions for study material and allows them to be trusted more within the community!</p>

          <h2 class="feature__title">Security and Integrity</h2>
          <p class="feature__description">Only students who know their material and have verified institutional emails can help others and themselves out, we ensure this by making every student take a test for their desired level and only once it has been passed can they actually start teaching. This means that there won't be middle schoolers with no idea teaching stressed out college students allowing everyone to make maximum worth of their time.</p>
